"Firstly the parts of the car is not at all good, what I come to know later is that this company is a Chinese one and just to make mark in India they registered as UK based company which is very much false. If you can check in the internet you can come to know that Chinese hold major shares in the company and the parts used to build the car is manufactured in China which you all know how quality will that China cheap parts be!","July 26, 2019",1,carwale.com

"Buying Experience: Only one dealer in entire Telangana and most of the staff is straight from college. Over & above overwhelming bookings . Now you can imagine the customer experience. Heard some customers are using all possible recommendations to speed up their delivery. You can imagine the rest. Riding Experience: I drove MG Hector (Sharp) Petrol Hybrid for more than 1000kms. Both in city traffic (200km) and on national highway (800km). It gives superior comfort for driver/passengers . HiTech features makes you feel like you are in full control of the car. No complaints in this section. Over all I am very happy. Details about look: I liked the external design of the car. For me it appears like a mini Toyota Fortuner from some angles. Performance: After driving it in different roads in city & highways, I don't feel the acceleration is leaner enough in all gears. Overall I felt it is ""sluggish"" / ""under powered"" . I am not an auto expert to give figures on RPM vs Torque etc. Even the fuel efficiency is not up to the figures declared by MG India (i.e. 15.8 kmpl). I only got 9 to 10 kmpl in city & 11 to 13kmpl in Highways. Finally I would like to say this car is a good value for money.","September 11, 2019",3,carwale.com
"I got a chance to Drive this Car . I didn't Expect That the petrol Hybrid Engine Gives This Type of power. This Engine Really Awesome. The 1.5 ltr Hybrid Engine Gives a lot of Power in the Mid-range Up to 2000 rpm some amount of lag but its pull so Quickly. And The safety features of this car is Very good 6 Airbag Abs EBD TC Hill hold etc. The Design of this Car is Awesome And The comfort also Very Good The Rear Passenger Gets Rear Arm Rest Rear Ac Vents and Good Amount of Space. And The Main Attraction of this Car Internet Inside 10.4 inch Huge Touch screen It's Really Awesome The Sound Quality Is Also Great . Pros 1. Value for Money 2. Fully Loaded By the Way of Features In this Price like Panoramic Sunroof, 10 inch Touch screen With Android Auto And Apple Car Play With 5G Sim Support, Electrically Adjustable Driver seat Etc 3. Safety Cons 1. The Breaking is Okey Not that Great","November 06, 2019",5,carwale.com
"The overall genuine review must-read who want to buy this car 1. My buying exp. Is awesome the showroom people were very polite and responsible. And I opted for black mg hector top-end diesel 2. I have already done 20000 kms in 4 months and at first, there is a clutch issue and I thought this was a bad car but it isn't the company replaced my clutch with a dust cover not it is riding excellently and on Hyderabad ring road I've hit 185kmph and it feels like going 100 kmph inside the cabin there is 0 vibration and noises....overall very nice. 3. The looks were Mind boggling just awesome the black was insane.when it comes to performance in 2nd gear the power was lacking but overall the performance was brilliant absolutely no doubt 4.pros and cons PROS *Stunning looks *Great power *Roomy cabin *Amazing features *Cheaper price for that car i would pay min. 25 lack for that car CONS *STEERING WOULD HAVE MORE FEEL AND FEEDBACK BUT ITS FINE WHEN WE GAIN SPEED. THAT'S IT.","December 09, 2019",5,carwale.com
"Mg hector is one of the best suv segment car in india.it is basically competition with harrier,creata and jeep pros:it has good pickup 2.it has smooth drive. Cons:1 isssue with voice command either it doesn't recognize or it listen to what you talks 2.display touch -it display is not responding sometimes 3.cooling issue in the rear section ac is not much effective as it has panaromic sunroof it has high temperature in rear section cooling is not effective in summer. 4.battery is not so good thats why mg provide one year warranty on that.","July 25, 2019",3,carwale.com
"Buying experience: Sales number define the gravity of the car and flock of customer booking. Riding experience: one of the worst experience as the acceleration is worst in the segment. I bet if you take this in traffic it will take her two second just to respond. Details: well tough it's an internet car and first in the segment. The only feature enactment is voice command worthy enough to test. Well didn't they just fit an ipad. It feels like a copied version. Also the screen frickles while it was standing at showroom they ac touchbar went flickering. It's a common thing for a car to have a dc electronic convertor for a car standing at showroom but this happed with the car too. Maybe they require a software update the right side, the bonut is not aligned to the body. So there might be an assembly issue to with the car. Honestly, I went to buy with confidence. But that engine ruined by decision. It's not responsive at all. And the assembly thing might cause vibration in future with my experience.","July 10, 2019",3,carwale.com
This car is nothing but a cheap quality chinese car the petrol hybrid version is waste and its lack much power .... This version of the car is low on power and according to the massive expensive price range .... Jeep compass is much better option .....I was thinking of selling my jeep compass when i saw MG but after riding it i regret my descision ..... I chose to keep using my jeep compass for another 1 year instead of buying This RUBBISH MG HECTOR ...... FIRST of all this same car is provided to different car brands in the world so it no unique This car is provided to the Brands like CHEVROLET BAOJUN 350 WULING ALMAZ Type this on net and you will find this same car with different badging .....

"This is a China car I have used this car for a short period of time for one month and there were some small scratch on the bumper while driving I scratched a small post and I wanted to repair it so I went to the MG work shop and I asked a claim in the warranty and they refused it and they said that paint is not included in the warranty and I asked the price for painting they said it is 50,000 only I got angry and I left the place and I can’t accept that for a cheap China car I should give this much money this car is not worth and it’s cheap plastic interiors and I exchanged it and bought a Honda CR-V","July 22, 2019",1,carwale.com
"This car being new entrant has been set at the right price between Creta and Harrier. Comparatively has a lot on offer especially features and technology. Really like the tire temperature indicators. UI on main head unit is a bit slower. Hope they will update it soon. Not very good for offroading as the over hang is too much reducing approach angle from both ends. Tired are a size smaller compared to the overall size of this SUV. Bus quality is very good and have passed crash test with 5*. Overall it's at the best price. Long term reliability is still a question mark and to cover that MG are providing 5 years unlimited mileage warranty, I believe that comes at an add-on price.","June 29, 2019",5,carwale.com
"I'm honestly advising not to buy this car right now. Connectivity feature is a crap.Poor build quality. Touchscreen is really lagging.Voice recognition not working best as expected.

"I was reading the reviews mentioned on the portal and there was one review by Mr. Nishant Rao who claimed to have bought the car 2 weeks before the official deliveries started and gave full detailed review explaining how everything about this car is negative. This was a classic example of negative marketing from the people associated with other brands. MG has done a commendable work to start their innings in India. They are providing a extraordinary package with the aggressive pricing. It remains to see how the car performs and time.shall make it clear. As of now, Hector is quite impressive. P.S. beware of fake reviews","July 15, 2019",5,carwale.com

"I booked MG hector on 19th of July, 2019. I opted for Smart DCT, (Aurora Silver) at MG’s Showroom Ahmedabad which is owned by Concept Motors. I had driven MG hector before booking the car itself. But after booking it I still wanted a test drive. I was with the same Sales person from whom I booked the car. I was just cruising around on the service road, when there was a sudden thud in the engine. The car stopped immediately after that. I had to put it in 2nd Manual so that car started moving again. There was no response from the car in any other gears. I tried to manually adjust in 1-3-4-R none of them worked. In any of the gears other than 2nd I would see an orange coloured exclamation mark on the information cluster. The sales person told that there was some issue in the transmission. He called some guy from the tech team and found out the transmission had failed. The car had only 4200km on the test runs. I cancelled the booking very next day to which their manager told me to wait for a few days until we find what the issue was in regards to. But as I was adamant they proceeded with the refund. While booking they had promised to refund in 15 days though it took them 28 days to process it through and give me the cheque that too after alot of follow ups. The car is good on cosmetics, but I don’t think so that you can rely on the engine in the long run. MG still needs to refine the Engine according to the Indian roads. Giving variety of features won’t help if there is an issue with the Engine Quality.","September 09, 2019",1,carwale.com
"It's a beautiful suv design wise, no doubt about it. However the steering control is poor. The screen doesn't respond properly to the commands. Tyres look very small. Interior finish is ok type. Driver seats are adjustable but not comfortable. Worst part is the curtain of sunroof, which looks like a mosquito net, very thin. Front and back parts are made up of cheap plastic. A true Chinese product, you will be lured by beauty but actual performance is poor. Less service network, nil resale value.","June 28, 2019",3,carwale.com

"No doubtly this car is going to shake the whole market because it has more features ,but overall the IMHO I do not liked the design at all I still consider harrier or compass is better that how they looks This car is filled with a lot of features But sometimes these features will annoy you Like ""hello MG "" These are all gimmicky things to attract more and more audience.. Infact the seating of harrier is way better than the Hector Underthigh support is missing And the elements are copy from other manufacturers too! Like the rear is fully copied from Audi The infortainment system copied from Volvo Instrument cluster copied from Aston Martin To much coping from each other And at the end CHINESE ARE FAMOUS FOR COPING THINGS Overall the car is decent not so great .","June 30, 2019",3,carwale.com

After booking i got call from mg motors that i will get my car in December. Which is double the waiting period. Inshort. Mg motors made fake promise about delivery date and made wrong commitment. Now after 2 months mg motors is saying that you need to wait for 4 months more. So disappointed. A new car maker which i trust have broken it. 1st car. Going to cancle the booking.

"*Have not bought the car* 2. Riding Experience: To understand Hector properly, you'll have to drive it first. It is a big car and by big I mean bigger than XUV 500(In terms of length) and it's a heavy car. For a brief moment you'll forget about it's weight because of the incredibly light steering wheel but on corners and harder braking scenarios, It's quite evident. The front seats offer adequate under thigh and lower back support but would have loved it better if it had an option to control the lumbar support. The seats keep you in place during turns and is cushioned just right to offer better comfort over prolong periods of driving (Driven 300+kms in a stretch) Rear seats have more than enough headroom and legroom but you might end up wanting a little more under thigh support. I think that is compensated by the option of reclining rear seats which is a really good feature in my opinion. The Sunroof is massive and lets in a lot of light. Only the front portion opens up but is big enough. (Would highly recommend people from not sticking their body out). The suspension is soft and by soft I mean it's really good on uneven surfaces but when driving at highway speeds, it can get a little over wobbly oven sudden undulation. This is why I feel, it's a better car for in city long distance drives. Visibility all around is great except the rear where I find the rear glass a little too small but that is where you can use 360 degree cameras (Really helpful in tight parking spots) though the quality of the camera is not even close to being the level needed in a 20L+ car. The screen is BIG and has tons of features (Watch online videos for indepth) In short, it's good but laggy and annoying at times. In built TOM TOM maps is bad and not updated. Thank god the car has Apple Play and Android Auto, GOOGLE MAPS to the rescue. I think the best way to describe the cabin of Hector is that it's looks premium, first impression will be of a really high end expensive car but after sometime, the quality feels lacking and straight off cheap. No rattling sounds over my test runs but a few owners reported rattles from the sunroof. 3. Details about Looks, Performance, etc.: Looks being a subjective matter, i'll leave it for you to decide but I can give my two points about it: a) The car does not look well proportioned. (From back, looks too narrow, from sides, looks like an MPV due to smaller wheels and weird shaped quarter windows, looks the best from front.) b) The rims are perfectly sized but the tyres is what needs help. Narrow tyres and small side walls look bad with the body bulk on top. It desperately needs thicker and wider tyres. Current ones squeak over every sharpish turn. Not adequate. The 2.0 litre Fait engine is probably the best part about the car. It's punchy and decently refined. Won't leave you wanting more. I was able to get roughly 16 kmpl on highways and 12 ish within the city. Brakes are really good and give a very confidence building feel. Servicing and maintenance: Only time will tell about these factors but MG's 5 year warranty does give a sense of relief to a rather new and unknown brand. Pros: a) Bang for the buck. Feature loaded to the brim. b) Wonderful cruiser. c) Spacious for passengers as well as cargo. d) Very easy to drive. Does not feel big due to the light steering wheel. e) excellent engine. Really good drivability and decent fuel economy. f) Soft suspension offers really comfortable ride in city speeds but definitely not meant to be driven enthusiastically. Cons: a) Misses out on some really obvious features. Auto dimming IRVM, Ventilated seats, etc. b) Laggy screen (really disappointed) c) Overall plushness d) 'SAD' tyres. Needs an upgrade. e) Unknown after sales and service.","October 14, 2019",4,carwale.com

"Before writing these review I'm a car enthusiast have driven multiple car around the world and I always try to give an honest review, Now coming to the MG hector well do not think this is the same company which once had these fancy convertible and u just have the name, this car is a Chinese car owned by SAIC motors. Now one these car Pros: 1) looks although is vary person t person still it is good 2) Space is best in class (comparing harrier,compass,seltos,Xuv 500) Cons: 1) lack of power specially a 2 liter engine car it is shockingly under power with claim 169 bhp where as compass with 171 bhp seems way more powerful and it is surprising even car like ecosport/creta feels way more fun to drive. 2) Ghostly gear change even if you change the gear there is no change rpm for sometimes there is a sound from gearbox I have tested 2 hector and the same thing and these executive from showroom has no idea and they are very arrogent and saying this car has highest booking in india really funny business strategy. 3) Suspension : now that is a scary part, in some large bumps it feels like the parts are moving out similar bumps compass and xuv are running like anything , these is a cluntchy sound in any bump and the executives are saying it is happening is test drive car I really font think any suv with 3000 km should not make such thing. 4) The panoramic sunroof : it is taking long to open and close and especially once open making sound from he top, no way is is even close to compass sunroof. 5) The voice command does not work if there is mild sound outside. 60 The quality of the interior plastic seems cheap compared to the price range 7) The history of Chinese automobiles and their reliability (don't know what that will be in India and how that will go in the future) Final verdict : If you are spending this much increase 1 lakh more and go with Jeep compass limited plus or Mahindra Xuv500 W11(O), I have not tested seltos so can not comment on that else go for ecosport or creta you will spend less and these are value for money. This car is very very over hyped this is at least 8 lakh more than the quality.","October 14, 2019",1,carwale.com

1. My buying experience was soo good 2. Riding experience and comfort is extraordinary even I have my toyota fortuner but now due to comfort I prefer mg hector over fortuner 3. As everyone can see the look of this car awesome and latest design. In terms of performance the performance and power is not good as my fortuner but it’s good for a 1.5 L engine that you can expect for an engine like that over its value for every penny that you pay 4.Since it’s a new car I don’t know about the service and maintenance but I think so the cost of the service will be reasonable price But in showroom they told the service cost will not be more expensive 5. It’s over all a great car as expected But some more specifications are missing and low fuel economy,"November 05, 2019",5,carwale.com
