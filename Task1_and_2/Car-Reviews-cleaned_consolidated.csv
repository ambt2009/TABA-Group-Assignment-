To turn it on i need to turned off ignition of car and start it again.

"Kia seltos is no doubt a very good car in its segment but is it really worth that price? Has it priced it logically in a weak automobile market ? Is it worth paying premium for BS 6 diesel engines well before rules come in ? Why not buy other cars with best service network and great deals which will be more sweeter with GST cuts in few weeks ? Kia has opened pre bookings very early to see the demand. And seeing Indian customers' interest in seltos, it has priced the base (useless) variant below 10 lakhs to fool us. And other variants (which are worth buying) are priced high. If you look at pricing, base petrol and diesel variant differ by 30k only but all other variants have price difference of 1-1.2 lakhs. Few more fooling techniques adopted by kia : They created HT and GT lines to confuse customers and force us to buy costly variants. Top HTX plus doesnt get even safety features of GTX plus, leave alone few fancy features. AT is priced 1 lakh more than its respective variant, but no safety features are given as bonus (other car makers do that). DCT technology is new and it is tried on us , that too with premium pricing. Top variants of diesel AT and petrol DCT are priced same and also the base diesel and petrol MT are closely priced, but in between they are differing by 1-1.2 lakhs. Summary is that we all are at fault, since we have shown interest in seltos well before launch and pre-booked in large numbers. This has given kia (the new entrant) the confidence to price their models on higher side , even when automobile industry is facing biggest slump. Once crazy emotions come down for Indian customers, reality will sink in their minds and people will analyse closely the premium they are paying unnecessarily. It is not any hot cake that will be unavailable if you don't rush and buy now. Otherwise how dare a new comer company shall take Indian customers for ride and happily cashing in on their confusion, when all other car makers are reeling under pressure of slowdown. I have also booked this car, but I am not convinced to buy and take delivery for this same reason. HTX plus AT is wrongly over priced and it is same with few more variants. Why pay so much premium for untested car and company in a discounted market. This is my personal view.

"The Kia Seltos HTK+ model is the best value for money car in the tech line section. It has a 1.5 petrol engine which provides a very good drive experience. Buying experience- The staff is really friendly and will show you every single feature of all the models before letting you decide which model you want to buy. The car took 1 month to reach me but it was worth the wait. Riding experience- The ride experience was really nice. I bought the petrol variant. The mileage is really good. In the city it is around 14-16. I haven't tested in on the highway yet. The car xan go really fast but you may wanna slow down a little bit while taking turns because you may notice a little bit of traction. Looks- The car looks very up market, both internally and externally. It is loaded with awesome features. Servicing- Since i've bought it just recently i haven't done my servicing yet. Overall the car is very good and i love the experience. In my opinion, one should buy the kia seltos rather than going for other options in this price range.","October 13, 2019",4,carwale.com,Kia,0.9806,htk model best value money tech line section 1 5 petrol engine provides good drive experience buying experience staff really friendly show every single feature models letting decide model want buy took 1 month reach worth wait riding experience ride experience really nice bought petrol variant mileage really good city around 14 16 tested highway yet xan go really fast may wanna slow little bit taking turns may notice little bit traction looks looks market internally externally loaded awesome features servicing since bought recently done servicing yet overall good love experience opinion one buy rather going options price range

"This is actually the best offering in the current price range. People have been cribbing about features, well then pay for it! You forget it's technically not an Indian company, so taxes are more! The range topping GTX+ model which now also comes in both Petrol AND Diesel, comes with features that none of the vehicles in the current market offer. 6 Airbags are standard in the GTX+ models. As is ABS and EBD! The suspension might not be as good as the Harrier's, but then you forget that has the suspension from the Range Rover Discovery. So in-short, this is actually the best suspension in the mid-size SUV segment. At ?20.5 lacs (on-road TN) for the ranging topping editions, this automobile is pretty much the best that you can get. Servicing, might be an issue for now. But if Hyundai is able to provide support in any way, I believe KIA will never let us down in that regard either. The end result is that KIA was able to bring in a very trendy and highly-equipped package into the Indian market, and at a very good time too!","September 14, 2019",5,carwale.com,Kia,0.4866,actually best offering current price range people cribbing features well pay forget technically indian company taxes range topping gtx model also comes petrol diesel comes features none vehicles current market offer 6 airbags standard gtx models abs ebd suspension might good harrier forget suspension range rover discovery short actually best suspension mid size suv segment 20 5 lacs road tn ranging topping editions automobile pretty much best get servicing might issue hyundai able provide support way believe never let us regard either end result able bring trendy highly equipped package indian market good time

"Had test-driven the petrol CVT version. The exterior looks and the interior quality is definitely worth talking about! Great looks, sleek yet bold. Interiors are up there with the likes of expensive cars. But alas that's all the good I can say. I had a lot expectations from Kia on this but turned out to a be a big disappointment. The 1.5 engine mated to the CVT gearbox is not fun to drive at all. Doesn't justify the steep pricing as well. Extremely underpowered. Haven't driven the version with the DCT. Suspension on low speeds are ok but the higher you go, you can feel the bumps in the car. Not sure of it's SUV capacity, but I am not sure it may live up to enthusiasts. Ingress and egress was surprisingly not good in my experience, I am 6'2 for reference.

"I had taken test drive Three Times to convince myself to take delivery of the GTX Plus AT , which I booked pre-launch. Unfortunately, more I drived, more dissatisfied from all angles. Cost is too High - Top Model 20.50 lakhs. Fuel average not more than 9 or 10 KMPH when I reset to Zero and tested myself. Seating in both rows is very uncomfortable. Navigation is very confusing.

"I am jeep owner from almost 2 years and after driving it more than 40k km I am writing this review. I don't advise people to buy it. Following are the pros and cons Pros..... 1) Its built quality and exterior is good. 2) You get good grip and control on high speed on highways. Cons...... 1) Jeep compass probably the worst SUV in its segment which has extremely poor and if I have to be blunt then pathetic turning radius and you literally have to take reverse on each U-turn in the city and if you are driving it cities like Mumbai, Bangalore then you are done. 2) even after taking care of the vehicle and getting it serviced on time the car started making noise. It's arm rest makes noise even the cover around steering wheel also not fitted well which also makes noise. 3) someone broke my wind shield which I got it replaced with new one but the size of new wind shield is little small and has not been fixed well it is making sound from the moment I got it fixed. 4) Most important point its engine stopped 3 times once on Express Highway and did not start then you have to wait for 20 minutes to get it started again which is terrible for a SUV where you have paid 20L. Even my 12 years old Honda City Engine never had this issue. 5) fabric seat covers after paying 20L is something you don't expect.

"To, JEEP INDIA TEAM. Greetings of the Day !!! I recently bought the much hipped safety oriented INTERNATIONAL car JEEP COMPASS from your S G HIGHWAY BASED CONCEPT DEALER. The reason behind wiring this E-mail is to Replace my Faulty Car with New Jeep Model or money in cash. Just before few days when we were travelling on Ahmedabad to Surat Highway your Jeep Compass had serious build and make issue. While the running conditions at only 90KMPH the Fuel Pump (Diesel) Started Draining out Heavily. But to our fortune we smelled something wrong in the car and we immediately stop it by the side of highway. While inspecting the car on the highway we have found that its fuel pump was full of leakage and the diesel was draining out fast. As you already know that I have purchased it just before 6 Months and has drawn It for just about 20000 Kms with all regular paid services from your dealer. In any case your Jeep Compass Model in India is not conforming to the safety and performance standards of International Level which you try to claim in your much hipped marketing in television and other related medias. However, In that case I want full refund of my money or if you provide me enough assurance that this type of problem will not appear again in your vehicle than I shall be ready to have a new car from your company as a replacement to my existing car. I hope that Jeep India team will understand my situation as I am paying my hard earned money behind your faulty and damaged Jeep Compass car, I shall not be ready to collect back this faulty model from your dealership after repairs and would like to request the competent authority to provide prompt justification in my case on urgent basis. Due to your faulty model Jeep Compass my business plans are totally disturbed and I have already faced a moral and indirect lost of more than 1.5 Lakh Indian rupees during last week. In short, I am providing you the only two options to choose from before I personally litigate you in the court of Law: 1) Refund my Full Money of Jeep Compass and take back your Faulty Vehicle. 2) Replace this Faulty Vehicle with the New Vehicle and Provide me an Assurance in Writing that If the same problem is found (with in12 Months again) in the new piece of vehicle you shall be liable to refund my full money in Cash. I am writing this letter as a formal complain to justify my stand and provide time of 5 Days to your company authority before I initiate a legal procedures against your company and the dealer from where I have been made fool to purchase this faulty and damaged vehicle. Look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

"I bought the jeep compass limited 4×4 in july under there upgrade plan for 4×4. So i purchased the car at a price of 23 lac instead of 25 lac on road.

I have one problem regarding some features but many of them has already been included in the limited plus trim at a cost of 2 lac more, so no issue of that also. My only suggestion to Jeep india is to price the longitude option model at 21 lac on road because of the newely arrived harrier. And please launch a diesel automatic in limited trim. If they do this than definitely there sales will reach around 1800 units a month. My suggestion to customer is if you are planning for a SUV and your budget is over 21-22 lac than definitely go for compass.

"Buying experience of Jeep Compass is completely good package because of its safety features, brand value, commanding design, fun to drive and off-road chops. Riding experience is outstanding specially in diesel variant because it is more powerful than it's rivals. Ride Quality is outstanding and amazing on the highways is a great cruiser around the corners and stability of this car is perfect. The looks of compass remains one of the most attractive design in its segment with its seven-slat grille and squared off wheel arches proudly proclaiming it's iconic jeep heritage. Performance is excellent around the corners and body roll is excellent on the highways. Compass 4×4 limited plus variant goes over the off-off-road with ease because of its independent suspension. Servicing cost and maintenance cost is very reasonable and jeep have introduced Mopar, the global giants in all jeep vehicles. Mopar is one-stop shop for your jeep vehicle's, maintenance, service, performance upgradesupgrades and cosmetic increases, so your jeep vehicle stays in perfect condition for your adventures always. Pros and Cons: PROS: 1.) It gets panaromic sunroof in top of the variant. 2.) Acceleration is outstanding than its rivals. 3.) Fit and finish is excellent and interior quality is top notch and feel premium than its rivals. 4.) Class leading off road capabilities with its independent suspension. 5.) Smooth Manual Gearbox and easy to use. 6.) Owing to Off-Road charactercharacter, compass gets four driving in top of the variants in its selec- Terrain all wheel drive system such as Auto, Snow, Sand and Mud to adjust engine mapping and traction control to move easily over the selected terrain. 7.) Diesel motor is punchier, nicer to drive and good highway cruiser. CONS: 1.) Too Pricey 2.) Poor Rear Seat Comfort and feels claustrophobic and not good for three adults. 3.) Clutch of Diesel variant is much heavier and not good for city use. 4.) 7 speed DCT Automatic is not very smooth, quickest, lacks punch and feels jerkiness. 5.) Missing some features. 6.) Petrol engine is very noisy than its rivals. 7.) The brakes are good, but while slowing down from high speeds it seems to lack the necessary bite for sharp and effective braking.","July 26, 2019",5,carwale.com,Jeep,0.9924,buying experience completely good package safety features brand value commanding design fun drive road chops riding experience outstanding specially diesel variant powerful rivals ride quality outstanding amazing highways great cruiser around corners stability perfect looks remains one attractive design segment seven slat grille squared wheel arches proudly proclaiming iconic heritage performance excellent around corners body roll excellent highways 4 4 limited plus variant goes road ease independent suspension servicing cost maintenance cost reasonable introduced mopar global giants vehicles mopar one stop shop vehicle maintenance service performance upgradesupgrades cosmetic increases vehicle stays perfect condition adventures always pros cons pros 1 gets panaromic sunroof top variant 2 acceleration outstanding rivals 3 fit finish excellent interior quality top notch feel premium rivals 4 class leading road capabilities independent suspension 5 smooth manual gearbox easy use 6 owing road charactercharacter gets four driving top variants selec terrain wheel drive system auto snow sand mud adjust engine mapping traction control move easily selected terrain 7 diesel motor punchier nicer drive good highway cruiser cons 1 pricey 2 poor rear seat comfort feels claustrophobic good three adults 3 clutch diesel variant much heavier good city use 4 7 speed dct automatic smooth quickest lacks punch feels jerkiness 5 missing features 6 petrol engine noisy rivals 7 brakes good slowing high speeds seems lack necessary bite sharp effective braking

"I had to write this review. It’s been about 5 months since I am driving Jeep Compass and mileage on odo just crossed 12,000 km. Bought it on 21 Feb 2019. Car was available quickly as they were clearing off 2018 stock and I got approx 90k benefits. Buying experience was awesome, smooth and spotless. I requested my chosen day delivery which Landmark Gurgaon guys were able to accommodate. First look of car and must say I fell in love with this machine. Car was delivered around 7 pm on 21st Feb which was a bit late. Didn’t know if any pre-delivery checks needed to be carried out by dealership guys at that point of time. But just got the car keys handed over in a ceremonial style with dealership guys clapping and taking pictures of key handing over. First 500 KM: Spotless except one incident. Just before 500km on odo, car suddenly stopped and would not start. “Service Engine” message was popping up on instrument panel. I had to wait for about half an hour before trying to start the engine. Engine started but it was enough for me to get worried. Called up my dealership contact and told him about the incident. Next day he sent someone from dealership and the “engine service” message was taken care of presumably by hard resetting car’s info message panel. My dealership contact told they had topped up engine oil and done pre-delivery checks which were not done at the time of delivery. I was surprised how could they miss that! But didn’t know myself about this check at the time of delivery. First 5000 km: Got my first free servicing done at 5000 km.Experience was quite nice. Service center in Sector 34 Gurgaon had AC waiting hall and offered coffee and water. It took around 5 hours in servicing. They did wheel alignment and balancing apart from topping up all oils. Interior and exterior of car got cleaned. I had two long trips by this time: first of about 1300 km to and fro Delhi-Haridwar-Mussoorie-Delhi with a bit of detour and second of about 2000 km to and fro Delhi-Lucknow-Gorakhpur-Muzzafarpur-Delhi. Overall driving experience was awesome. It was March and weather was still a bit cold. Took Yamuna Expressway and newly built Agra-Lucknow Expressway. Fuel economy was roughly around 13.5 km/litre for both trips. Must say road grip and stability of Compass is way too superior. Cruising at around 120-160 mark was effortless and never realized till the time I saw odometer. Happy happy except one incident where I got a big dent on driver’s side rear door while backing up and didn’t got idea of side wall and got rubbed against it - thinking it would have been better should Jeep have provided 360 degree view camera which we see in one segment lower Kicks and recently launched Hector. However, came back Delhi and got it claimed through 0 dep insurance. Total bill was Rs. 7500 and I had to pay Rs. 2000 as deductible. The D-Day: This is when I became really disappointed with Jeep Compass, Jeep India team and Landmark dealership. I was again on a long road trip of around 2000 KM stretch back to my hometown Gopalganj and was traveling across Yamuna Expressway. It was 1:30 pm on a hot sunny day on 25-May-2019 with temperature ranging about 45 degrees and my odo mileage around 8800 KM. I was traveling along with my pregnant wife, mom and my puppy Blaze at a speed between 90-100 km/hour. Just before Mathura toll plaza of Yamuna Expressway, my passenger side rear Tyre got burst into pieces. I could smell something burning in my cabin and was about to apply brakes when I felt a sudden jolt but still could not figure out what went wrong. I didn’t lose control of my steering wheel, didn’t apply brakes, took off my leg from accelerator and just let wheels roll over. When speed was less than 60 km/hour I applied brakes slightly and then immediately released. By this time, I knew some Tyre got burst as car was wobbling. I put on my left side indicators and started moving toward side curb. After about 0.7 KM from the location where Tyre got burst, I was able to pull over the curb. Luckily, cars traveling behind me, saw this entire episode happening right in front and slowed down. I was in complete shock, out of mind and didn’t know how to react for a brief time once I stopped. Three cars stopped to know our well-being and helped me over with Tyre change. One of the guy from those cars also brought back the burst piece of Tyre lying more than half km behind and I could see few burn marks in his hand because of the heat from burst Tyre. I averted a major personal catastrophe which could well have life long implications on my remaining family if we were not able to survive on so called Road to Hell cemented Yamuna Expressway. Bursting of Tyre was totally unexpected given I had checked air pressure just before starting the trip and it was just 3 months 4 days old car having 8800 km on odo. I was so infuriated and agitated that I immediately called up Jeep India customer care and Landmark service center to report this incident. Resolution Provided for Burst Tyre from Jeep India and Landmark dealership: Tyre is not covered directly by Jeep and coverage comes from Tyre manufacturer which in this case is Bridgestone. Firestone Tyres manufactured by Bridgestone is used in Jeep Compass up to Limited Plus editions. After inspection of the burst Tyre, Bridgestone told that burst happened due to side wall damage of Tyre because of low/flat pressure and not because of any manufacturing defect and rejected the claim. Jeep India replaced the burst Tyre free of cost as a goodwill gesture. I knew my Tyres were in good condition, almost new and also had checked the air pressure before starting the trip, so there was no way air pressure would come down. I told them that Tyre was not able to handle the heat generated by cemented Yamuna Expressway on a hot sunny noon and as a result oxygen inside the Tyre would have expanded to a limit which the Tyre was not able to handle and got burst. I googled about Jeep Compass Tyre burst and could spot few reviews where people have faced similar Tyre bursts in a hot day because of the substandard quality of Firestone Tyres used in Jeep Compass. I spent around 24 lakhs to buy this vehicle just to know that Tyres are not covered by Jeep warranty and Tyre manufacturer Bridgestone would not accept claim giving rubbish reasons of low/flat Tyre pressure. Jeep should have provided this vehicle without Tyres and would have asked customers to choose Tyres of their choicest manufacturer since warranty is covered by manufacturer. I asked Jeep India team to provide Firestone Tyre compatibility and safety check report for Jeep Compass on Indian road conditions which they must have done before launching Jeep Compass but they failed to provide. I went through online Consumer Affair portal and lodged a complaint against Jeep Compass for this incident and to ask them to replace my all four Tyres with a much reliable Tyre brand like Michelin or Goodyear but none outcome to my favor!","July 16, 2019",2,carwale.com,Jeep,-0.9058,write review 5 months since driving mileage odo crossed 12 000 km bought 21 feb 2019 available quickly clearing 2018 stock got approx 90k benefits buying experience awesome smooth spotless requested chosen day delivery landmark gurgaon guys able accommodate first look must say fell love machine delivered around 7 pm 21st feb bit late know pre delivery checks needed carried dealership guys point time got keys handed ceremonial style dealership guys clapping taking pictures key handing first 500 km spotless except one incident 500km odo suddenly stopped would start service engine message popping instrument panel wait half hour trying start engine engine started enough get worried called dealership contact told incident next day sent someone dealership engine service message taken care presumably hard resetting info message panel dealership contact told topped engine oil done pre delivery checks done time delivery surprised could miss know check time delivery first 5000 km got first free servicing done 5000 km experience quite nice service center sector 34 gurgaon ac waiting hall offered coffee water took around 5 hours servicing wheel alignment balancing apart topping oils interior exterior got cleaned two long trips time first 1300 km fro delhi haridwar mussoorie delhi bit detour second 2000 km fro delhi lucknow gorakhpur muzzafarpur delhi overall driving experience awesome march weather still bit cold took yamuna expressway newly built agra lucknow expressway fuel economy roughly around 13 5 km litre trips must say road grip stability way superior cruising around 120 160 mark effortless never realized till time saw odometer happy happy except one incident got big dent driver side rear door backing got idea side wall got rubbed thinking would better provided 360 degree view camera see one segment lower kicks recently launched however came back delhi got claimed 0 dep insurance total bill rs 7500 pay rs 2000 deductible day became really disappointed india team landmark dealership long road trip around 2000 km stretch back hometown gopalganj traveling across yamuna expressway 1 30 pm hot sunny day 25 may 2019 temperature ranging 45 degrees odo mileage around 8800 km traveling along pregnant wife mom puppy blaze speed 90 100 km hour mathura toll plaza yamuna expressway passenger side rear tyre got burst pieces could smell something burning cabin apply brakes felt sudden jolt still could figure went wrong lose control steering wheel apply brakes took leg accelerator let wheels roll speed less 60 km hour applied brakes slightly immediately released time knew tyre got burst wobbling put left side indicators started moving toward side curb 0 7 km location tyre got burst able pull curb luckily cars traveling behind saw entire episode happening right front slowed complete shock mind know react brief time stopped three cars stopped know well helped tyre change one guy cars also brought back burst piece tyre lying half km behind could see burn marks hand heat burst tyre averted major personal catastrophe could well life long implications remaining family able survive called road hell cemented yamuna expressway bursting tyre totally unexpected given checked air pressure starting trip 3 months 4 days old 8800 km odo infuriated agitated immediately called india customer care landmark service center report incident resolution provided burst tyre india landmark dealership tyre covered directly coverage comes tyre manufacturer case bridgestone firestone tyres manufactured bridgestone used limited plus editions inspection burst tyre bridgestone told burst happened due side wall damage tyre low flat pressure manufacturing defect rejected claim india replaced burst tyre free cost goodwill gesture knew tyres good condition almost new also checked air pressure starting trip way air pressure would come told tyre able handle heat generated cemented yamuna expressway hot sunny noon result oxygen inside tyre would expanded limit tyre able handle got burst googled tyre burst could spot reviews people faced similar tyre bursts hot day substandard quality firestone tyres used spent around 24 lakhs buy vehicle know tyres covered warranty tyre manufacturer bridgestone would accept claim giving rubbish reasons low flat tyre pressure provided vehicle without tyres would asked customers choose tyres choicest manufacturer since warranty covered manufacturer asked india team provide firestone tyre compatibility safety check report indian road conditions must done launching failed provide went online consumer affair portal lodged complaint incident ask replace four tyres much reliable tyre brand like michelin goodyear none outcome favor

"Just 1 month after purchase, engine malfunction light started glowing. Took vehicle to local dealership and light went off. Soon it glowed again and engine started excessive vibrations and jerks.

"Lets make it short and simple. 1. Jeep doesn't have alot of dealers and most cities have just one. These people kind of hold a monopoly position so getting better deals is next to non. These dealers usually have a very obsolete method of ordering cars which ends up extending the delivery date from the date of booking for over a month in most cases. 2. Compass feels sturdy and rides over most bumps with super ease. The car is still a little bit on the stiffer side so some bumps can get to you in a little more aggressive manner but that leads to a better handling car which for it's size is pretty darn great. There is the typical turbo lag under 1.8k RPM but not very zombie-ish types. There is a good punch of power right after the mark but tbh, it doesn't feel like a 170ish bhp car. Maybe thats the output at crank and not at wheels. The cabin might be a little small for people who expect to carry a soccer team in a 23L car but for 4 adults, space is more than enough. Top of all that, it gets a panoramic sunroof which is lovely, especially during the summers where it'll get you skin tanned to a 4th degree burn!! Well jokes aside, it does make the cabin a lot more appealing and even the car as a whole feels more worth the price with the addition of a few new features in the limited plus option but strangely misses out on cruise control(i dont see much use of it but most people i spoke to about he car hate this miss) The looks of the car comes down to your perspective. I truly believe this car looks amazing especially in the dark grey shade with the black glossy roof. The only point of uncertainty is the reliability issues coming up with this car. A few common issues are- A) premature clutch burn B) brakes failure C) electronics failure (music system, startstop) D) poor quality control (exposed parts in the interior and water leaking into taillight) But I'd still go for the car for the premium feeling interior or i might not got for it thanks to white colour leather seats and arm rest which will get soiled in less than an hour in Indian climate conditions Thanks.","October 11, 2018",3,carwale.com,Jeep,0.9753,lets make short simple 1 alot dealers cities one people kind hold monopoly position getting better deals next non dealers usually obsolete method ordering cars ends extending delivery date date booking month cases 2 feels sturdy rides bumps super ease still little bit stiffer side bumps get little aggressive manner leads better handling size pretty darn great typical turbo lag 1 8k rpm zombie ish types good punch power right mark tbh feel like 170ish bhp maybe thats output crank wheels cabin might little small people expect carry soccer team 23l 4 adults space enough top gets panoramic sunroof lovely especially summers get skin tanned 4th degree burn well jokes aside make cabin lot appealing even whole feels worth price addition new features limited plus option strangely misses cruise control dont see much use people spoke hate miss looks comes perspective truly believe looks amazing especially dark grey shade black glossy roof point uncertainty reliability issues coming common issues premature clutch burn b brakes failure c electronics failure music system startstop poor quality control exposed parts interior water leaking taillight still go premium feeling interior might got thanks white colour leather seats arm rest get soiled less hour indian climate conditions thanks

"I bought my car from Jeep store @omr RDC royale on Januar 4th 2018. The buying experience was good barring a couple of days delay. They even arranged for the pujas to be done prior to taking delivery of the car. I was very thrilled to take it on the highways, but had to wait 3 months for that to happen. And finally when the day came it was all the more exciting. The sheer torque and the power of the car made it feel like flying on the highways. The steering was always in control even at 170 kmph. The car felt well grounded at high speed overtakes and on the straight line too. One thing i was really disappointed with was the mileage which i got only 12.5 kmpl even on the highways. My hometown doesn't have good roads as we see in the metros, but my Jeep was able to tackle all the bad patches. With ease, which is a testimony to the ride quality of the car. Although everything was going good, when i was returning home from a long drive i noticed that the ESP warning had started glowing. That is the only problem i have faced with the vehicle till now.

"Buying experience of Jeep compass sport model is too good because it is the base model of Jeep compass starting from 15 laks onwards. Riding experience of this model is a top notch in both city and highway but on highway is a great cruiser. The body roll of Jeep compass is outstanding around the corners and stability is also outstanding on the highways and which is the best in the segment. This is the only petrol SUV comes with maximum power around 161bhp and highest than its rivals. Looks of Jeep Compass is the best in its segment with seven slat grille with commanding design, looking dynamic and looks sportier. Performance is outstanding with 1.4 litre petrol engine because it drives smoothly, punchier and nicer to drive. Jeep compass petrol mileage around 15 to 16 kmpl on the highways if you drive not too much fast and in city 10 to 12 kmpl. Servicing and maintainence of compass is reasonable and not much expensive in petrol variants while in diesel it is too expensive to maintain the vehicle and while servicing cost is expensive. PROS: 1. It comes with safety features such as EPB, ESP, Hill Start Assist, Roll Over Mitigation, All Disc Brakes, Traction Control and Hill Descent Control as standard. 2.) 6 speed manual gearbox is joy and easy to use. 3.) Class leading off road capabilities. 4.) Build quality and interior quality is a top notch and best in the segment. 5.) Plastic quality and materials are used on the compass are extremely superb and best in its class. 6.) The individual suspension set up of the compass which further increases its off-road capabilities. CONS: 1. Missing some features like cruise control, electric ORVM turn indicators, alloy wheels and other features etc. 2. Poor rear seat comfort and feels cramped for three adults. 3. The petrol engine is noisy than the other rivals like creta and hector. 4. Too pricey 5.

"I have always been a fan of the Compass since it was launched back in 2017. Being a student and a big car enthusiast, it was really hard to convince my parents to choose this car over the Creta (There was a 5 lakh rupees price difference!). Recently, my best friend got the newly launched Sport Plus 1.4 Petrol variant of the Compass(Harrier effect, maybe?). And I must say, I wish my family had waited for this. He surprisingly agreed to take the Compass for a road trip to Rishikesh which we've been planning for days and I got to drive this beauty for quite a while to write this review. Under the hood, this two-wheel-drive car packs the same Fiat-sourced 1.4 litre turbo petrol engine producing 160 bhp of power and 250 Nm of torque which we've already seen in the top spec variants. The car is loaded! We get 16 inch Alloy wheels, roof rails, dual zone automatic climate control, a 5 inch touchscreen infotainment system with 4 speakers and all the standard safety features along with the signature electronic parking brake. One more thing, there's a hidden easter egg near the bonnet of the car and it's just better that you notice it yourself. Some people might find the infotainment unit smaller compared to the 7 inch one seen in higher variants, but not us! It doesn't have a stock rear parking camera, but you can install that as an accessory. The speakers work really well. Also, conventional headlamps are provided with this variant and there's no sunroof on offer. Now let's talk about driving this beauty. This car, is a beast! The turbo kicks in after 2300 rpm and you get that kick in the pants feeling. This car crushed all the bad roads which we encountered in the hills. Although the suspension is a bit on the stiffer side, body roll is negligible and the Compass feels so much alive when you're cruising through those corners and the brakes work very well. Arguably this variant, the Sports Plus, will give you the most bang for your buck. It packs all the necessary features, and even more! This is a proper driver's car with much practicality on offer. Priced at 15.60 lakhs ex-showroom, I would definitely recommend this Compass to all the interested buyers in this segment.

"I bought a Jeep Compass Longitude optional a year back in Sep 2017 and was enjoying my rides like any other users, the overall performance of the vehicle is as good as expected, BUT when I went for the service my overall experience is turned down. I met with a minor accident and went for servicing the car at TURBO auto in Vijayawada, Andhrapradesh as I have only one choice in this city and they informed me that radiator and inter cooling system needs to be replaced along with the front bumper. It took 11 days for them to complete the work as I understood that the time would take for them in general is not more than 2 or 3 days. the reason as I understood is the spare parts was not being maintained by the service centres and I wonder the first thing that will get damage is the bumper and radiator when a car meets with the accident. Though I got the comprehensive insurance, when went to take the vehicle for delivery I was asked to pay 8600 Rs additional amount as they installed a bumper with chrome which they claim is not covered by the insurer (Bharathi Axa). which after enquiry with the service advisor understood that the part which the service centre guys ordered somehow changed ( I wonder how this could happen for a service oriented industry's these days) and when I denied to pay for what I have not asked neither chose the service centre guys denied to deliver the vehicle and asked for one more day to remove the chrome from the bumper to and deliver the vehicle and I have to leave the vehicle again at service centre to fix the right one.

My longest trip was 1,800 km, I loved to drive more and more and my family felt very comfortable and no complaint even after travelling such a long journey.

"Buying Experience: I had a decent buying experience from Landmark Gurgaon. Although, they changed the delivery timelines twice but the Sales Manager was responsive, mostly. Riding Experience: Majorly, its been very good riding experience. On the Highways, its one of the best monocoque SUVs on the Indian roads. In city conditions, the ride can get a bit bumpy due to stiff suspension, however, there's a very reassuring feeling to be in this cabin. Looks & Performance: Looks for this butch SUV is the trump card. It looks premium and sure is a head-turner with those 18 inch alloys. For the performance, I'd rate this as a decent 4/5. Although, there's a bit of a lag initially (due to the turbo), however, if you get the hang of throttle response you can actually make the pick-up very linear. It has a very strong mid range and pulls very nicely for the weight of this car and never feels under powered. Service & Maintenance: I've got my car services once and the experience was fine. However, i believe there's an issue with the Battery from most buyers i have spoken to. Pros: Great looks, Safety features and robust cabin, convenient to drive with Automatic, fit & finish of the cabin Cons: Not great on Value for money especially compared to Kia Seltos, few key features missing in Indian version like Cruise Control, Fuel economy can be underwhelming for few for petrol auto.","September 23, 2019",4,carwale.com,Jeep,0.9881,buying experience decent buying experience landmark gurgaon although changed delivery timelines twice sales manager responsive mostly riding experience majorly good riding experience highways one best monocoque suvs indian roads city conditions ride get bit bumpy due stiff suspension however reassuring feeling cabin looks performance looks butch suv trump card looks premium sure head turner 18 inch alloys performance rate decent 4 5 although bit lag initially due turbo however get hang throttle response actually make pick linear strong mid range pulls nicely weight never feels powered service maintenance got services experience fine however believe issue battery buyers spoken pros great looks safety features robust cabin convenient drive automatic fit finish cabin cons great value money especially compared key features missing indian version like cruise control fuel economy underwhelming petrol auto

Both in city traffic (200km) and on national highway (800km). It gives superior comfort for driver/passengers . HiTech features makes you feel like you are in full control of the car. No complaints in this section. Over all I am very happy. Details about look: I liked the external design of the car. For me it appears like a mini Toyota Fortuner from some angles. Performance: After driving it in different roads in city & highways, I don't feel the acceleration is leaner enough in all gears. Overall I felt it is ""sluggish"" / ""under powered"" . I am not an auto expert to give figures on RPM vs Torque etc. Even the fuel efficiency is not up to the figures declared by MG India (i.e. 15.8 kmpl).

"I booked MG hector on 19th of July, 2019. I opted for Smart DCT, (Aurora Silver) at MG’s Showroom Ahmedabad which is owned by Concept Motors. I had driven MG hector before booking the car itself. But after booking it I still wanted a test drive. I was with the same Sales person from whom I booked the car. I was just cruising around on the service road, when there was a sudden thud in the engine. The car stopped immediately after that. I had to put it in 2nd Manual so that car started moving again. There was no response from the car in any other gears. I tried to manually adjust in 1-3-4-R none of them worked. In any of the gears other than 2nd I would see an orange coloured exclamation mark on the information cluster. The sales person told that there was some issue in the transmission. He called some guy from the tech team and found out the transmission had failed. The car had only 4200km on the test runs. I cancelled the booking very next day to which their manager told me to wait for a few days until we find what the issue was in regards to. But as I was adamant they proceeded with the refund. While booking they had promised to refund in 15 days though it took them 28 days to process it through and give me the cheque that too after alot of follow ups. The car is good on cosmetics, but I don’t think so that you can rely on the engine in the long run. MG still needs to refine the Engine according to the Indian roads.

"*Have not bought the car* 2. Riding Experience: To understand Hector properly, you'll have to drive it first. It is a big car and by big I mean bigger than XUV 500(In terms of length) and it's a heavy car. For a brief moment you'll forget about it's weight because of the incredibly light steering wheel but on corners and harder braking scenarios, It's quite evident. The front seats offer adequate under thigh and lower back support but would have loved it better if it had an option to control the lumbar support. The seats keep you in place during turns and is cushioned just right to offer better comfort over prolong periods of driving (Driven 300+kms in a stretch) Rear seats have more than enough headroom and legroom but you might end up wanting a little more under thigh support. I think that is compensated by the option of reclining rear seats which is a really good feature in my opinion. The Sunroof is massive and lets in a lot of light. Only the front portion opens up but is big enough. (Would highly recommend people from not sticking their body out). The suspension is soft and by soft I mean it's really good on uneven surfaces but when driving at highway speeds, it can get a little over wobbly oven sudden undulation. This is why I feel, it's a better car for in city long distance drives. Visibility all around is great except the rear where I find the rear glass a little too small but that is where you can use 360 degree cameras (Really helpful in tight parking spots) though the quality of the camera is not even close to being the level needed in a 20L+ car. The screen is BIG and has tons of features (Watch online videos for indepth) In short, it's good but laggy and annoying at times. In built TOM TOM maps is bad and not updated. Thank god the car has Apple Play and Android Auto, GOOGLE MAPS to the rescue. I think the best way to describe the cabin of Hector is that it's looks premium, first impression will be of a really high end expensive car but after sometime, the quality feels lacking and straight off cheap. No rattling sounds over my test runs but a few owners reported rattles from the sunroof. 3. Details about Looks, Performance, etc.: Looks being a subjective matter, i'll leave it for you to decide but I can give my two points about it: a) The car does not look well proportioned. (From back, looks too narrow, from sides, looks like an MPV due to smaller wheels and weird shaped quarter windows, looks the best from front.) b) The rims are perfectly sized but the tyres is what needs help. Narrow tyres and small side walls look bad with the body bulk on top. It desperately needs thicker and wider tyres. Current ones squeak over every sharpish turn. Not adequate. The 2.0 litre Fait engine is probably the best part about the car. It's punchy and decently refined. Won't leave you wanting more. I was able to get roughly 16 kmpl on highways and 12 ish within the city. Brakes are really good and give a very confidence building feel. Servicing and maintenance: Only time will tell about these factors but MG's 5 year warranty does give a sense of relief to a rather new and unknown brand. Pros: a) Bang for the buck. Feature loaded to the brim. b) Wonderful cruiser. c) Spacious for passengers as well as cargo. d) Very easy to drive. Does not feel big due to the light steering wheel. e) excellent engine. Really good drivability and decent fuel economy. f) Soft suspension offers really comfortable ride in city speeds but definitely not meant to be driven enthusiastically. Cons: a) Misses out on some really obvious features. Auto dimming IRVM, Ventilated seats, etc. b) Laggy screen (really disappointed) c) Overall plushness d) 'SAD' tyres. Needs an upgrade. e) Unknown after sales and service.","October 14, 2019",4,carwale.com,MG,0.9991,bought 2 riding experience understand properly drive first big big mean bigger xuv 500 terms length heavy brief moment forget weight incredibly light steering wheel corners harder braking scenarios quite evident front seats offer adequate thigh lower back support would loved better option control lumbar support seats keep place turns cushioned right offer better comfort prolong periods driving driven 300 kms stretch rear seats enough headroom legroom might end wanting little thigh support think compensated option reclining rear seats really good feature opinion sunroof massive lets lot light front portion opens big enough would highly recommend people sticking body suspension soft soft mean really good uneven surfaces driving highway speeds get little wobbly oven sudden undulation feel better city long distance drives visibility around great except rear find rear glass little small use 360 degree cameras really helpful tight parking spots though quality camera even close level needed 20l screen big tons features watch online videos indepth short good laggy annoying times built tom tom maps bad updated thank god apple play android auto google maps rescue think best way describe cabin looks premium first impression really high end expensive sometime quality feels lacking straight cheap rattling sounds test runs owners reported rattles sunroof 3 details looks performance etc looks subjective matter leave decide give two points look well proportioned back looks narrow sides looks like mpv due smaller wheels weird shaped quarter windows looks best front b rims perfectly sized tyres needs help narrow tyres small side walls look bad body bulk top desperately needs thicker wider tyres current ones squeak every sharpish turn adequate 2 0 litre fait engine probably best part punchy decently refined leave wanting able get roughly 16 kmpl highways 12 ish within city brakes really good give confidence building feel servicing maintenance time tell factors 5 year warranty give sense relief rather new unknown brand pros bang buck feature loaded brim b wonderful cruiser c spacious passengers well cargo easy drive feel big due light steering wheel e excellent engine really good drivability decent fuel economy f soft suspension offers really comfortable ride city speeds definitely meant driven enthusiastically cons misses really obvious features auto dimming irvm ventilated seats etc b laggy screen really disappointed c overall plushness sad tyres needs upgrade e unknown sales service

Now one these car Pros: 1) looks although is vary person t person still it is good 2) Space is best in class (comparing harrier,compass,seltos,Xuv 500) Cons: 1) lack of power specially a 2 liter engine car it is shockingly under power with claim 169 bhp where as compass with 171 bhp seems way more powerful and it is surprising even car like ecosport/creta feels way more fun to drive. 2) Ghostly gear change even if you change the gear there is no change rpm for sometimes there is a sound from gearbox I have tested 2 hector and the same thing and these executive from showroom has no idea and they are very arrogent and saying this car has highest booking in india really funny business strategy. 3) Suspension : now that is a scary part, in some large bumps it feels like the parts are moving out similar bumps compass and xuv are running like anything , these is a cluntchy sound in any bump and the executives are saying it is happening is test drive car I really font think any suv with 3000 km should not make such thing. 4) The panoramic sunroof : it is taking long to open and close and especially once open making sound from he top, no way is is even close to compass sunroof. 5) The voice command does not work if there is mild sound outside. 60 The quality of the interior plastic seems cheap compared to the price range 7) The history of Chinese automobiles and their reliability (don't know what that will be in India and how that will go in the future) Final verdict : If you are spending this much increase 1 lakh more and go with Jeep compass limited plus or Mahindra Xuv500 W11(O), I have not tested seltos so can not comment on that else go for ecosport or creta you will spend less and these are value for money.
