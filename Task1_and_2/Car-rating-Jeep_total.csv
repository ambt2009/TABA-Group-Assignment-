"I bought a Jeep Compass on 28/1/2018 and yesterday on 04/02/2018 my car got broke down on the highway some where around 200 km away from my home. i don't know how a new car started vibrating and it was making noise, it was so humiliating and embarrassing for me  because i was with my family and relatives on a holiday trip and then this happened to me,  my cousins were making jokes and laughing on the car (On ME), the company dealer is saying that they have identified the problem and resolved it but i am so pissed off with the car that i don't want it back, so either you buy back the car and give me my money back or either give me a new piece because if the product is doing this within 7 days of purchase than I am sorry but I don't have any future expectations with this.    so just looking into this matter and resolve my issue because i don't expected this sort of CHEAP performance from a company like JEEP   samarth jain meerut","February 06, 2018",2,carwale.com
"We brought a jeep compass about 20 days back.  On receiving the vehicle, there was a constant clatter from the front pair of doors or panels.  On reporting this, they took the vehicle to the workshop promptly, reporting post return, the issue has been resolved.  In turn, while one door, the noise had dampened, though not eradicated, on the other door, the sound had increased.  Now I have to myself try multiple maneuvres to try and reduce the noise.  The staff were helpful in the showroom but frankly, they are sales people and they could hardly make out the real issue.  Now I am still awaiting a call from their Pune office to correct the issue and mind you, this is only 28 days post buying the vehicle.","July 17, 2018",2,carwale.com

"Before I start the detailed review, let me express a concern over the genuinity of the reviews posted by people who don't own the vehicle. For those who go by cumulative rating, 3.5 stars seems way too less.

"My favorite and dream car it's smooth driving and high speed engine colors very very love it..... My The 2018 Compass is available in four trim levels: Sport, Latitude, Limited and Trailhawk.

"A CAR NOT TO BUY This car's turbo sets in around 2500 rpm. Till it reaches this rpm the car hardly moves, then suddenly it flies off the handle. This is impossible to control under most circumstances. In my opinion it is an accident waiting to happen. When i bring this up with the service station they just shrug it off as normal in all Jeep cars. It has pathetic fuel efficiency. Be that as it may the engine capacity is so small that the car needs refueling constantly. I cannot go from Bangalore to Mysore and back without refueling. I discovered this pretty early after buying the car. I decided to sell if even before i reached 1000 kms and one month after i purchased the car. When i inquired the purchase price, i was not even getting a quote for 17 lakhs. I paid 24.66 lakhs for the car. Though most cars lose their value once you drive out of the showroom, the Jeep's resale demand is non existent. In my opinion these cars should be banned from sale in India","June 06, 2019",1,carwale.com

"I would like to talk about the performance. There is an inherent Clutch/gear issue. My clutch burnt at 13000 kms. The service center states that, the vehicle is not suitable for city conditions and the clutch has relatively smaller grooves, which makes it wear out faster. They claim, they have reported to the Jeep, but not sure if they will take any action. I got the clutch replaced, and am now getting clucking sound, whenever I change the gears, or slow down/speedup. The service center states its normal, but i can clearly see that, its not RIGHT. I have now no idea what to do now!!!","November 15, 2018",2,carwale.com
"I am jeep owner from almost 2 years and after driving it more than 40k km I am writing this review. I don't advise people to buy it. Following are the pros and cons Pros..... 1) Its built quality and exterior is good. 2) You get good grip and control on high speed on highways. Cons...... 1) Jeep compass probably the worst SUV in its segment which has extremely poor and if I have to be blunt then pathetic turning radius and you literally have to take reverse on each U-turn in the city and if you are driving it cities like Mumbai, Bangalore then you are done. 2) even after taking care of the vehicle and getting it serviced on time the car started making noise. It's arm rest makes noise even the cover around steering wheel also not fitted well which also makes noise. 3) someone broke my wind shield which I got it replaced with new one but the size of new wind shield is little small and has not been fixed well it is making sound from the moment I got it fixed. 4) Most important point its engine stopped 3 times once on Express Highway and did not start then you have to wait for 20 minutes to get it started again which is terrible for a SUV where you have paid 20L. Even my 12 years old Honda City Engine never had this issue. 5) fabric seat covers after paying 20L is something you don't expect. In my opinion you should go for other SUVs instead of putting 20L in this or wait for another year to get better options as it has all basic features which you can get in any 10-12L car except electronic hand break. I bought this car thinking that its American brand and its going to be good product and after sales service but they have failed in both. They are selling inferior quality or they couldn't import quality which they sell in US or they are purposely selling poor quality products thinking that it's India and they can twist rules and regulations the way they want.","July 22, 2019",2,carwale.com
"I purchased this car in recently and drove 800km in all conditions (in city/ highway etc---). I am getting an average mileage of 5.4 km/litre instead of 12-14 which company is offering. Please check the mileage of this car before buying this variant. It is a petrol variant with an engine capacity is 1.4, not worth to drive this car if you get an average of 5.4/km.",,1,carwale.com
Exterior I don't really like huge SUV's (like the Fortuner or Endeavour) and in my opinion the Compass is just perfect. Its not too small and not too big. The design compliments the size very well giving it a superb road presence. I love the side profile and that chrome strip that differentiates the rood and the rest of the body. I love the rear which is complimented with a nicely done LED tail lights. (even non-led's looks good).,"September 14, 2017",4,carwale.com
"The buying experience was good. The only mistake I did, never checked the mileage of the car. I believed the sales person who told me the average mileage is 14-17km/L. The Jeep team is not ready to accept the mileage issues. I have sent several mails to the entire Jeep team and there were no reply and solution. I am getting an average mileage of 5-6KM/L after driving 2500km with different conditions. My humble request to all customers who are planning to buy Jeep compass, please check the mileage on different conditions (traffic /non traffic etc.) to get the real mileage. Do not believe the sales person who just want to sell the car.",,1,carwale.com

"To, JEEP INDIA TEAM. Greetings of the Day !!! I recently bought the much hipped safety oriented INTERNATIONAL car JEEP COMPASS from your S G HIGHWAY BASED CONCEPT DEALER. The reason behind wiring this E-mail is to Replace my Faulty Car with New Jeep Model or money in cash. Just before few days when we were travelling on Ahmedabad to Surat Highway your Jeep Compass had serious build and make issue. While the running conditions at only 90KMPH the Fuel Pump (Diesel) Started Draining out Heavily. But to our fortune we smelled something wrong in the car and we immediately stop it by the side of highway. While inspecting the car on the highway we have found that its fuel pump was full of leakage and the diesel was draining out fast. As you already know that I have purchased it just before 6 Months and has drawn It for just about 20000 Kms with all regular paid services from your dealer. In any case your Jeep Compass Model in India is not conforming to the safety and performance standards of International Level which you try to claim in your much hipped marketing in television and other related medias. However, In that case I want full refund of my money or if you provide me enough assurance that this type of problem will not appear again in your vehicle than I shall be ready to have a new car from your company as a replacement to my existing car. I hope that Jeep India team will understand my situation as I am paying my hard earned money behind your faulty and damaged Jeep Compass car, I shall not be ready to collect back this faulty model from your dealership after repairs and would like to request the competent authority to provide prompt justification in my case on urgent basis. Due to your faulty model Jeep Compass my business plans are totally disturbed and I have already faced a moral and indirect lost of more than 1.5 Lakh Indian rupees during last week. In short, I am providing you the only two options to choose from before I personally litigate you in the court of Law: 1) Refund my Full Money of Jeep Compass and take back your Faulty Vehicle. 2) Replace this Faulty Vehicle with the New Vehicle and Provide me an Assurance in Writing that If the same problem is found (with in12 Months again) in the new piece of vehicle you shall be liable to refund my full money in Cash. I am writing this letter as a formal complain to justify my stand and provide time of 5 Days to your company authority before I initiate a legal procedures against your company and the dealer from where I have been made fool to purchase this faulty and damaged vehicle. Look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Regards, MILAN PATEL Unfortunate Owner of You Jeep Compass GJ01XXXXXX AHMEDABAD 9909XXXXXX","October 08, 2018",1,carwale.com

The looks are conventional yet appealing, LED headlights and rear lights gives it a distinct look. 17 inch tyres looks good on the body.The car looks beefy yet elegant at the same time. Enter the cabin and you cocoon yourself from the outside world. The door closes with a thunk which gives you an idea of the built quality. Start the car and you realize that engine is quiet enough. The audio quality of the infotainment system is good. The car drives really well at high speeds and is sturdy. While cornering the car it is steady , some body roll is there but ride quality is good.

"I bought the jeep compass limited 4×4 in july under there upgrade plan for 4×4. So i purchased the car at a price of 23 lac instead of 25 lac on road. One thing i would i to say is that this is the beast when it comes to pure driving experience. No suv under 35 lac can beat it in terms of performance. I have one problem regarding some features but many of them has already been included in the limited plus trim at a cost of 2 lac more, so no issue of that also. My only suggestion to Jeep india is to price the longitude option model at 21 lac on road because of the newely arrived harrier. And please launch a diesel automatic in limited trim. If they do this than definitely there sales will reach around 1800 units a month. My suggestion to customer is if you are planning for a SUV and your budget is over 21-22 lac than definitely go for compass. But if your budget is tight around 18-19 lac than go for harrier XZ over creta and other. Remember one thing only the XZ model of harrier is good to purchase because the rest of models lacks safety features which are on my priority number 1.","January 25, 2019",5,carwale.com

"Buying experience of Jeep Compass is completely good package because of its safety features, brand value, commanding design, fun to drive and off-road chops. Riding experience is outstanding specially in diesel variant because it is more powerful than it's rivals. Ride Quality is outstanding and amazing on the highways is a great cruiser around the corners and stability of this car is perfect. The looks of compass remains one of the most attractive design in its segment with its seven-slat grille and squared off wheel arches proudly proclaiming it's iconic jeep heritage. Performance is excellent around the corners and body roll is excellent on the highways. Compass 4×4 limited plus variant goes over the off-off-road with ease because of its independent suspension. Servicing cost and maintenance cost is very reasonable and jeep have introduced Mopar, the global giants in all jeep vehicles. Mopar is one-stop shop for your jeep vehicle's, maintenance, service, performance upgradesupgrades and cosmetic increases, so your jeep vehicle stays in perfect condition for your adventures always. Pros and Cons: PROS: 1.) It gets panaromic sunroof in top of the variant. 2.) Acceleration is outstanding than its rivals. 3.) Fit and finish is excellent and interior quality is top notch and feel premium than its rivals. 4.) Class leading off road capabilities with its independent suspension. 5.) Smooth Manual Gearbox and easy to use. 6.) Owing to Off-Road charactercharacter, compass gets four driving in top of the variants in its selec- Terrain all wheel drive system such as Auto, Snow, Sand and Mud to adjust engine mapping and traction control to move easily over the selected terrain. 7.) Diesel motor is punchier, nicer to drive and good highway cruiser. CONS: 1.) Too Pricey 2.) Poor Rear Seat Comfort and feels claustrophobic and not good for three adults. 3.) Clutch of Diesel variant is much heavier and not good for city use. 4.) 7 speed DCT Automatic is not very smooth, quickest, lacks punch and feels jerkiness. 5.) Missing some features. 6.) Petrol engine is very noisy than its rivals. 7.) The brakes are good, but while slowing down from high speeds it seems to lack the necessary bite for sharp and effective braking.","July 26, 2019",5,carwale.com

"I had to write this review. It’s been about 5 months since I am driving Jeep Compass and mileage on odo just crossed 12,000 km. Bought it on 21 Feb 2019. Car was available quickly as they were clearing off 2018 stock and I got approx 90k benefits. Buying experience was awesome, smooth and spotless. I requested my chosen day delivery which Landmark Gurgaon guys were able to accommodate. First look of car and must say I fell in love with this machine. Car was delivered around 7 pm on 21st Feb which was a bit late. Didn’t know if any pre-delivery checks needed to be carried out by dealership guys at that point of time. But just got the car keys handed over in a ceremonial style with dealership guys clapping and taking pictures of key handing over. First 500 KM: Spotless except one incident. Just before 500km on odo, car suddenly stopped and would not start. “Service Engine” message was popping up on instrument panel. I had to wait for about half an hour before trying to start the engine. Engine started but it was enough for me to get worried. Called up my dealership contact and told him about the incident. Next day he sent someone from dealership and the “engine service” message was taken care of presumably by hard resetting car’s info message panel. My dealership contact told they had topped up engine oil and done pre-delivery checks which were not done at the time of delivery. I was surprised how could they miss that! But didn’t know myself about this check at the time of delivery. First 5000 km: Got my first free servicing done at 5000 km.Experience was quite nice. Service center in Sector 34 Gurgaon had AC waiting hall and offered coffee and water. It took around 5 hours in servicing. They did wheel alignment and balancing apart from topping up all oils. Interior and exterior of car got cleaned. I had two long trips by this time: first of about 1300 km to and fro Delhi-Haridwar-Mussoorie-Delhi with a bit of detour and second of about 2000 km to and fro Delhi-Lucknow-Gorakhpur-Muzzafarpur-Delhi. Overall driving experience was awesome. It was March and weather was still a bit cold. Took Yamuna Expressway and newly built Agra-Lucknow Expressway. Fuel economy was roughly around 13.5 km/litre for both trips. Must say road grip and stability of Compass is way too superior. Cruising at around 120-160 mark was effortless and never realized till the time I saw odometer. Happy happy except one incident where I got a big dent on driver’s side rear door while backing up and didn’t got idea of side wall and got rubbed against it - thinking it would have been better should Jeep have provided 360 degree view camera which we see in one segment lower Kicks and recently launched Hector. However, came back Delhi and got it claimed through 0 dep insurance. Total bill was Rs. 7500 and I had to pay Rs. 2000 as deductible. The D-Day: This is when I became really disappointed with Jeep Compass, Jeep India team and Landmark dealership. I was again on a long road trip of around 2000 KM stretch back to my hometown Gopalganj and was traveling across Yamuna Expressway. It was 1:30 pm on a hot sunny day on 25-May-2019 with temperature ranging about 45 degrees and my odo mileage around 8800 KM. I was traveling along with my pregnant wife, mom and my puppy Blaze at a speed between 90-100 km/hour. Just before Mathura toll plaza of Yamuna Expressway, my passenger side rear Tyre got burst into pieces. I could smell something burning in my cabin and was about to apply brakes when I felt a sudden jolt but still could not figure out what went wrong. I didn’t lose control of my steering wheel, didn’t apply brakes, took off my leg from accelerator and just let wheels roll over. When speed was less than 60 km/hour I applied brakes slightly and then immediately released. By this time, I knew some Tyre got burst as car was wobbling. I put on my left side indicators and started moving toward side curb. After about 0.7 KM from the location where Tyre got burst, I was able to pull over the curb. Luckily, cars traveling behind me, saw this entire episode happening right in front and slowed down. I was in complete shock, out of mind and didn’t know how to react for a brief time once I stopped. Three cars stopped to know our well-being and helped me over with Tyre change. One of the guy from those cars also brought back the burst piece of Tyre lying more than half km behind and I could see few burn marks in his hand because of the heat from burst Tyre. I averted a major personal catastrophe which could well have life long implications on my remaining family if we were not able to survive on so called Road to Hell cemented Yamuna Expressway. Bursting of Tyre was totally unexpected given I had checked air pressure just before starting the trip and it was just 3 months 4 days old car having 8800 km on odo. I was so infuriated and agitated that I immediately called up Jeep India customer care and Landmark service center to report this incident. Resolution Provided for Burst Tyre from Jeep India and Landmark dealership: Tyre is not covered directly by Jeep and coverage comes from Tyre manufacturer which in this case is Bridgestone. Firestone Tyres manufactured by Bridgestone is used in Jeep Compass up to Limited Plus editions. After inspection of the burst Tyre, Bridgestone told that burst happened due to side wall damage of Tyre because of low/flat pressure and not because of any manufacturing defect and rejected the claim. Jeep India replaced the burst Tyre free of cost as a goodwill gesture. I knew my Tyres were in good condition, almost new and also had checked the air pressure before starting the trip, so there was no way air pressure would come down. I told them that Tyre was not able to handle the heat generated by cemented Yamuna Expressway on a hot sunny noon and as a result oxygen inside the Tyre would have expanded to a limit which the Tyre was not able to handle and got burst. I googled about Jeep Compass Tyre burst and could spot few reviews where people have faced similar Tyre bursts in a hot day because of the substandard quality of Firestone Tyres used in Jeep Compass. I spent around 24 lakhs to buy this vehicle just to know that Tyres are not covered by Jeep warranty and Tyre manufacturer Bridgestone would not accept claim giving rubbish reasons of low/flat Tyre pressure. Jeep should have provided this vehicle without Tyres and would have asked customers to choose Tyres of their choicest manufacturer since warranty is covered by manufacturer. I asked Jeep India team to provide Firestone Tyre compatibility and safety check report for Jeep Compass on Indian road conditions which they must have done before launching Jeep Compass but they failed to provide. I went through online Consumer Affair portal and lodged a complaint against Jeep Compass for this incident and to ask them to replace my all four Tyres with a much reliable Tyre brand like Michelin or Goodyear but none outcome to my favor!","July 16, 2019",2,carwale.com

"Lets make it short and simple. 1. Jeep doesn't have alot of dealers and most cities have just one. These people kind of hold a monopoly position so getting better deals is next to non. These dealers usually have a very obsolete method of ordering cars which ends up extending the delivery date from the date of booking for over a month in most cases. 2. Compass feels sturdy and rides over most bumps with super ease. The car is still a little bit on the stiffer side so some bumps can get to you in a little more aggressive manner but that leads to a better handling car which for it's size is pretty darn great. There is the typical turbo lag under 1.8k RPM but not very zombie-ish types. There is a good punch of power right after the mark but tbh, it doesn't feel like a 170ish bhp car. Maybe thats the output at crank and not at wheels. The cabin might be a little small for people who expect to carry a soccer team in a 23L car but for 4 adults, space is more than enough. Top of all that, it gets a panoramic sunroof which is lovely, especially during the summers where it'll get you skin tanned to a 4th degree burn!! Well jokes aside, it does make the cabin a lot more appealing and even the car as a whole feels more worth the price with the addition of a few new features in the limited plus option but strangely misses out on cruise control(i dont see much use of it but most people i spoke to about he car hate this miss) The looks of the car comes down to your perspective. I truly believe this car looks amazing especially in the dark grey shade with the black glossy roof. The only point of uncertainty is the reliability issues coming up with this car. A few common issues are- A) premature clutch burn B) brakes failure C) electronics failure (music system, startstop) D) poor quality control (exposed parts in the interior and water leaking into taillight) But I'd still go for the car for the premium feeling interior or i might not got for it thanks to white colour leather seats and arm rest which will get soiled in less than an hour in Indian climate conditions Thanks.","October 11, 2018",3,carwale.com

"I bought my car from Jeep store @omr RDC royale on Januar 4th 2018. The buying experience was good barring a couple of days delay. They even arranged for the pujas to be done prior to taking delivery of the car. I was very thrilled to take it on the highways, but had to wait 3 months for that to happen. And finally when the day came it was all the more exciting. The sheer torque and the power of the car made it feel like flying on the highways. The steering was always in control even at 170 kmph. The car felt well grounded at high speed overtakes and on the straight line too. One thing i was really disappointed with was the mileage which i got only 12.5 kmpl even on the highways. My hometown doesn't have good roads as we see in the metros, but my Jeep was able to tackle all the bad patches. With ease, which is a testimony to the ride quality of the car. Although everything was going good, when i was returning home from a long drive i noticed that the ESP warning had started glowing. That is the only problem i have faced with the vehicle till now. Although i was disappointed with this problem, i feel its a minor issue and would be sorted out easily. Hoping for a million miles journey with my beast.","December 16, 2018",4,carwale.com

Pros n cons Look wise it’s muscular stylish. We bot Compass limited petrol at on road it almost rch 25lakhs. But really sorry to say that it doesn’t have any basic freatures which provides in Hyundai Elantra Sx model. Driver seat adjustment it’s like ordinary style. That disgusting. Interior look very cheap. Rear seat is not comfortable for a long drive. Comfort wise Hyundai creta is way better. It’s a plastic car I would say. Nothing other than looks. Their is no music adjustments on steering wheeel. Really disappointed we dint go for a test drive. That we trusted jeep so much 3/10.,"November 14, 2018",2,carwale.com

"First of all thanks to car wale for helping me to decide and short list the car i wanted. I have gone through the reviews, which were not that good before buying this beast. I took a call and bought limited plus edition. Its a wonderful car. You can compare this with audi q3. The comparison of this car is not at all with creta top end or xuv500 or tata harrier, this car stands apart. Had gone upto 170km/hr but still the vehicle was under my control. Ride and handling is excellent. The NVH level is well within control. Mileage should be more than 10 as i have driven only 500km and each time there's an increment in mileage. Music systen is good. 5 persons with weekend luggage can accommodate easily.","July 03, 2019",4,carwale.com

"Buying experience of Jeep compass sport model is too good because it is the base model of Jeep compass starting from 15 laks onwards. Riding experience of this model is a top notch in both city and highway but on highway is a great cruiser. The body roll of Jeep compass is outstanding around the corners and stability is also outstanding on the highways and which is the best in the segment. This is the only petrol SUV comes with maximum power around 161bhp and highest than its rivals. Looks of Jeep Compass is the best in its segment with seven slat grille with commanding design, looking dynamic and looks sportier. Performance is outstanding with 1.4 litre petrol engine because it drives smoothly, punchier and nicer to drive. Jeep compass petrol mileage around 15 to 16 kmpl on the highways if you drive not too much fast and in city 10 to 12 kmpl. Servicing and maintainence of compass is reasonable and not much expensive in petrol variants while in diesel it is too expensive to maintain the vehicle and while servicing cost is expensive. PROS: 1. It comes with safety features such as EPB, ESP, Hill Start Assist, Roll Over Mitigation, All Disc Brakes, Traction Control and Hill Descent Control as standard. 2.) 6 speed manual gearbox is joy and easy to use. 3.) Class leading off road capabilities. 4.) Build quality and interior quality is a top notch and best in the segment. 5.) Plastic quality and materials are used on the compass are extremely superb and best in its class. 6.) The individual suspension set up of the compass which further increases its off-road capabilities. CONS: 1. Missing some features like cruise control, electric ORVM turn indicators, alloy wheels and other features etc. 2. Poor rear seat comfort and feels cramped for three adults. 3. The petrol engine is noisy than the other rivals like creta and hector. 4. Too pricey 5. The brakes are good, but while slowing down from high speeds it seems to lack the necessary bite for sharp and effective braking. 6. 7 speed DCT automatic transmission is not very smooth, quickest, lacks punch and feels jerkiness on the highways.","July 30, 2019",5,carwale.com

"I have always been a fan of the Compass since it was launched back in 2017. Being a student and a big car enthusiast, it was really hard to convince my parents to choose this car over the Creta (There was a 5 lakh rupees price difference!). Recently, my best friend got the newly launched Sport Plus 1.4 Petrol variant of the Compass(Harrier effect, maybe?). And I must say, I wish my family had waited for this. He surprisingly agreed to take the Compass for a road trip to Rishikesh which we've been planning for days and I got to drive this beauty for quite a while to write this review. Under the hood, this two-wheel-drive car packs the same Fiat-sourced 1.4 litre turbo petrol engine producing 160 bhp of power and 250 Nm of torque which we've already seen in the top spec variants. The car is loaded! We get 16 inch Alloy wheels, roof rails, dual zone automatic climate control, a 5 inch touchscreen infotainment system with 4 speakers and all the standard safety features along with the signature electronic parking brake. One more thing, there's a hidden easter egg near the bonnet of the car and it's just better that you notice it yourself. Some people might find the infotainment unit smaller compared to the 7 inch one seen in higher variants, but not us! It doesn't have a stock rear parking camera, but you can install that as an accessory. The speakers work really well. Also, conventional headlamps are provided with this variant and there's no sunroof on offer. Now let's talk about driving this beauty. This car, is a beast! The turbo kicks in after 2300 rpm and you get that kick in the pants feeling. This car crushed all the bad roads which we encountered in the hills. Although the suspension is a bit on the stiffer side, body roll is negligible and the Compass feels so much alive when you're cruising through those corners and the brakes work very well. Arguably this variant, the Sports Plus, will give you the most bang for your buck. It packs all the necessary features, and even more! This is a proper driver's car with much practicality on offer. Priced at 15.60 lakhs ex-showroom, I would definitely recommend this Compass to all the interested buyers in this segment. Definitely a 5 star rating from my side!","June 14, 2019",5,carwale.com

"I bought a Jeep Compass Longitude optional a year back in Sep 2017 and was enjoying my rides like any other users, the overall performance of the vehicle is as good as expected, BUT when I went for the service my overall experience is turned down. I met with a minor accident and went for servicing the car at TURBO auto in Vijayawada, Andhrapradesh as I have only one choice in this city and they informed me that radiator and inter cooling system needs to be replaced along with the front bumper. It took 11 days for them to complete the work as I understood that the time would take for them in general is not more than 2 or 3 days. the reason as I understood is the spare parts was not being maintained by the service centres and I wonder the first thing that will get damage is the bumper and radiator when a car meets with the accident. Though I got the comprehensive insurance, when went to take the vehicle for delivery I was asked to pay 8600 Rs additional amount as they installed a bumper with chrome which they claim is not covered by the insurer (Bharathi Axa). which after enquiry with the service advisor understood that the part which the service centre guys ordered somehow changed ( I wonder how this could happen for a service oriented industry's these days) and when I denied to pay for what I have not asked neither chose the service centre guys denied to deliver the vehicle and asked for one more day to remove the chrome from the bumper to and deliver the vehicle and I have to leave the vehicle again at service centre to fix the right one. So after all these experiences I wonder why I chose a vehicle which is good to drive but very bad when you have to get it repaired.","December 06, 2018",2,carwale.com

Looks & Performance: Looks for this butch SUV is the trump card. It looks premium and sure is a head-turner with those 18 inch alloys. For the performance, I'd rate this as a decent 4/5. Although, there's a bit of a lag initially (due to the turbo), however, if you get the hang of throttle response you can actually make the pick-up very linear. It has a very strong mid range and pulls very nicely for the weight of this car and never feels under powered. Service & Maintenance: I've got my car services once and the experience was fine. However, i believe there's an issue with the Battery from most buyers i have spoken to. Pros: Great looks, Safety features and robust cabin, convenient to drive with Automatic, fit & finish of the cabin Cons: Not great on Value for money especially compared to Kia Seltos, few key features missing in Indian version like Cruise Control, Fuel economy can be underwhelming for few for petrol auto.","September 23, 2019",4,carwale.com

One word CARGASM. The way it delivers the power the way the turbo kicks is amazing. It lacks some features. If jeeps looks over it then it will be much better. But the performance no doubt. The best for performance. The suspension comfort is great.,"September 23, 2019",5,carwale.com
