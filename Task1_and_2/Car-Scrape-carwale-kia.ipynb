      "{'revtext': \"Kia seltos is no doubt a very good car in its segment but is it really worth that price? Has it priced it logically in a weak automobile market ? Is it worth paying premium for BS 6 diesel engines well before rules come in ? Why not buy other cars with best service network and great deals which will be more sweeter with GST cuts in few weeks ? Kia has opened pre bookings very early to see the demand. And seeing Indian customers' interest in seltos, it has priced the base (useless) variant below 10 lakhs to fool us. And other variants (which are worth buying) are priced high. If you look at pricing, base petrol and diesel variant differ by 30k only but all other variants have price difference of 1-1.2 lakhs. Few more fooling techniques adopted by kia : They created HT and GT lines to confuse customers and force us to buy costly variants. Top HTX plus doesnt get even safety features of GTX plus, leave alone few fancy features. AT is priced 1 lakh more than its respective variant, but no safety features are given as bonus (other car makers do that). DCT technology is new and it is tried on us , that too with premium pricing. Top variants of diesel AT and petrol DCT are priced same and also the base diesel and petrol MT are closely priced, but in between they are differing by 1-1.2 lakhs. Summary is that we all are at fault, since we have shown interest in seltos well before launch and pre-booked in large numbers. This has given kia (the new entrant) the confidence to price their models on higher side , even when automobile industry is facing biggest slump. Once crazy emotions come down for Indian customers, reality will sink in their minds and people will analyse closely the premium they are paying unnecessarily. It is not any hot cake that will be unavailable if you don't rush and buy now. Otherwise how dare a new comer company shall take Indian customers for ride and happily cashing in on their confusion, when all other car makers are reeling under pressure of slowdown. I have also booked this car, but I am not convinced to buy and take delivery for this same reason. HTX plus AT is wrongly over priced and it is same with few more variants. Why pay so much premium for untested car and company in a discounted market. This is my personal view.

The car took 1 month to reach me but it was worth the wait. Riding experience- The ride experience was really nice. I bought the petrol variant. The mileage is really good. In the city it is around 14-16. I haven't tested in on the highway yet. The car xan go really fast but you may wanna slow down a little bit while taking turns because you may notice a little bit of traction. Looks- The car looks very up market, both internally and externally. It is loaded with awesome features. Servicing- Since i've bought it just recently i haven't done my servicing yet.

As is ABS and EBD! The suspension might not be as good as the Harrier's, but then you forget that has the suspension from the Range Rover Discovery. So in-short, this is actually the best suspension in the mid-size SUV segment. At ?20.5 lacs (on-road TN) for the ranging topping editions, this automobile is pretty much the best that you can get. Servicing, might be an issue for now. But if Hyundai is able to provide support in any way, I believe KIA will never let us down in that regard either.
