"VERY WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE, WORST MILEAGE AND NO PICKUP, 21.75 LAKH ON ROAD PRICE,WASTE OF MONEY ,BECAUSE I BOUGHT SELTOS ON BEFORE 2 MONTHS IN COIMBATORE, DEALER SAID A SO MANY FUTURES IN CAR AND U HAD BEST SUV IN BS 6 ,ALL R FAKE BECAUSE I HAD A WORST EXPERIENCE IN LONG DRIVE 13.5 KM MILEAGE IN 80KM SPEED AND BREAKING SYSTEM R VERY WORST ,SERVICE COST IS MORE THEN HIGH COMPARISON OF CRETA AND DUSTER ,SO PLEASE DONT BY A SELTOS. SERVICE RESPONSE IS VERY VERY WORST IN YOUR LIFE TIME EXPERIENCE, MY ADVICE IS DON'T BYE SELTOS GTX AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION 7 DCT PETROL","December 04, 2019",1,carwale.com
"After spending 15.5 + lakhs you get basic features. HTX, HTX+ Petrol variants even do not have rear disk brakes! Only 2 airbags, no eps, no brake assist, no traction control! Wtf you get after so much just a look! They thinks Indians are cattles and they are dumb, they don't require safety? Can kia lust out details of features launched in Korea and elsewhere? People must stop buying this bullock cart!,","October 03, 2019",2,carwale.com
"I saw lots of people cribbing about how kia has come up with weak engines or price is little high.its a mid size suv.which competes with creta ,ecosport,duster.one can buy a good feature loaded car within 11 lakh.if you have budget more than that,then one can go for hector,harrier etc.as i am getting 1.5 lit petrol a one above base model within 11 lakh.its a good engine.5 people with all their luggage can accommodate easily.you are getting rugged looks(not like soft looking creta).what do you guys want in 10-11 lakh budget car.as i said if you have budget more than 11 lakh,then this may not be fit for you.comments likhne se pehle socha karo.11 lakh ke gaadi se fortuner ya endeavour wala tasan kyon expect karte ho.","September 19, 2019",5,carwale.com
"Messed up variant list, not offering even 4 airbags for on road price of 16 to 17 lacs is a crime. They should remove the gimmicky features and at least provide more than 2 airbags in HtX and HtK series. Wtff seriously KIA !!! And no top end for automatics...making same mistake as Hyundai , at least htx ivt should be available as a top end","August 22, 2019",3,carwale.com
"I booked the car on 29 August and was told delivery in 3 months. I wasn't convinced to buy because of 1.5 ltr engine and high price for cosmetics. But then no other option available other than creta. To my surprise even after 2.5 months, the dealer was not sure when the car will come. He asked to wait until December. Why should buy a car were waiting for 5 months and still be unsatisfied. I took the right decision to cancel. Don't book the car until 6-12 months review if you have any doubts, becoz the doubts are real for sure.","December 14, 2019",2,carwale.com
"Overpriced compared to MG Hector. Would had been a steal deal for 20.5 L on road. They stretched a over but on GTX+.Mostly, I will be cancelling my booking and going for Hector. And Beige interiors on top end?? It's ridiculous . Expected full black experience .","September 14, 2019",2,carwale.com
I bought my car on 27-Aug-2019 and driven about 500Km and could not found any complain in car performance. I have an major issue with infotainment system since the day one and Kia work shop is not able to provide the resolution for the same since more than a week. Issue Description - My infotainment system is getting powered off after some time frequently and no any button on panel is working. To turn it on i need to turned off ignition of car and start it again. I have complained the same to kia workshop on 31-Aug-2019 and they called me thrice at their work shop and could not able to fix it. It is very inconvenient while travelling on road and my infotainment gets switched off and i need stop my car on side and restart it again. Because of above issue my reverse camera display got switched off in between while parking and my cars bumper got scratches.,"September 06, 2019",5,carwale.com
"Kia seltos is no doubt a very good car in its segment but is it really worth that price? Has it priced it logically in a weak automobile market ? Is it worth paying premium for BS 6 diesel engines well before rules come in ? Why not buy other cars with best service network and great deals which will be more sweeter with GST cuts in few weeks ? Kia has opened pre bookings very early to see the demand. And seeing Indian customers' interest in seltos, it has priced the base (useless) variant below 10 lakhs to fool us. And other variants (which are worth buying) are priced high. If you look at pricing, base petrol and diesel variant differ by 30k only but all other variants have price difference of 1-1.2 lakhs. Few more fooling techniques adopted by kia : They created HT and GT lines to confuse customers and force us to buy costly variants. Top HTX plus doesnt get even safety features of GTX plus, leave alone few fancy features. AT is priced 1 lakh more than its respective variant, but no safety features are given as bonus (other car makers do that). DCT technology is new and it is tried on us , that too with premium pricing. Top variants of diesel AT and petrol DCT are priced same and also the base diesel and petrol MT are closely priced, but in between they are differing by 1-1.2 lakhs. Summary is that we all are at fault, since we have shown interest in seltos well before launch and pre-booked in large numbers. This has given kia (the new entrant) the confidence to price their models on higher side , even when automobile industry is facing biggest slump. Once crazy emotions come down for Indian customers, reality will sink in their minds and people will analyse closely the premium they are paying unnecessarily. It is not any hot cake that will be unavailable if you don't rush and buy now. Otherwise how dare a new comer company shall take Indian customers for ride and happily cashing in on their confusion, when all other car makers are reeling under pressure of slowdown. I have also booked this car, but I am not convinced to buy and take delivery for this same reason. HTX plus AT is wrongly over priced and it is same with few more variants. Why pay so much premium for untested car and company in a discounted market. This is my personal view. Pls comment on my review and suggest if my analysis is correct and is it worth waiting.","September 10, 2019",3,carwale.com
"I visited kia motors nasik on 25 august. I m very igar to see seltos, but unfortunately show not open, i wait for 1/2 hour, then 11am. I enter in show room. Car is superb. But salesman not notice me. I call them 2/3 times, but not interested to entertain me. Not give any details, very unprofessional behaviear, very disapointed with atittude of person of showroom and height, not even ask for test drive, i ask for quotation but it also not available, i suggest kia, improve service,","August 29, 2019",5,carwale.com
"The Kia Seltos HTK+ model is the best value for money car in the tech line section. It has a 1.5 petrol engine which provides a very good drive experience. Buying experience- The staff is really friendly and will show you every single feature of all the models before letting you decide which model you want to buy. The car took 1 month to reach me but it was worth the wait. Riding experience- The ride experience was really nice. I bought the petrol variant. The mileage is really good. In the city it is around 14-16. I haven't tested in on the highway yet. The car xan go really fast but you may wanna slow down a little bit while taking turns because you may notice a little bit of traction. Looks- The car looks very up market, both internally and externally. It is loaded with awesome features. Servicing- Since i've bought it just recently i haven't done my servicing yet. Overall the car is very good and i love the experience. In my opinion, one should buy the kia seltos rather than going for other options in this price range.","October 13, 2019",4,carwale.com
Seems like very good car..I wanted to buy HTK 1.5 petrol version. They don't have test drive for this version or any version with same petrol engine. I got diesel version test drive instead which has all together different engine specs. Dealer (Vadodara city in Gujarat) mentioned Kia is not giving test drive for 1.5 petrol engine. How can i purchase newly launched car without test drive?,"September 22, 2019",2,carwale.com
"We purchased Kia seltos yesterday. Remote control not working properly. Accational it works. We showed to mysore road showroom, they could not fix it today. They told we need to update software and thier people are coming from factory tomorrow. How for they will fix it's big question.","September 06, 2019",3,carwale.com
"This is actually the best offering in the current price range. People have been cribbing about features, well then pay for it! You forget it's technically not an Indian company, so taxes are more! The range topping GTX+ model which now also comes in both Petrol AND Diesel, comes with features that none of the vehicles in the current market offer. 6 Airbags are standard in the GTX+ models. As is ABS and EBD! The suspension might not be as good as the Harrier's, but then you forget that has the suspension from the Range Rover Discovery. So in-short, this is actually the best suspension in the mid-size SUV segment. At ?20.5 lacs (on-road TN) for the ranging topping editions, this automobile is pretty much the best that you can get. Servicing, might be an issue for now. But if Hyundai is able to provide support in any way, I believe KIA will never let us down in that regard either. The end result is that KIA was able to bring in a very trendy and highly-equipped package into the Indian market, and at a very good time too!","September 14, 2019",5,carwale.com
it so comfortable and it is feature loaded along with a sunroof also with comfortable automatic nice CAR we will rate it 5 stars. My absolutely favourite and loved the test drive experience for the car. The ride felt solid and well in control at both slow and high speed as well.,"September 22, 2019",5,carwale.com
"Had test-driven the petrol CVT version. The exterior looks and the interior quality is definitely worth talking about! Great looks, sleek yet bold. Interiors are up there with the likes of expensive cars. But alas that's all the good I can say. I had a lot expectations from Kia on this but turned out to a be a big disappointment. The 1.5 engine mated to the CVT gearbox is not fun to drive at all. Doesn't justify the steep pricing as well. Extremely underpowered. Haven't driven the version with the DCT. Suspension on low speeds are ok but the higher you go, you can feel the bumps in the car. Not sure of it's SUV capacity, but I am not sure it may live up to enthusiasts. Ingress and egress was surprisingly not good in my experience, I am 6'2 for reference. Not very good first impressions.","October 31, 2019",3,carwale.com
Excellent driving with fully loaded feature...htk+ petrol is value for money variant....better than present creta and also bigger and wider than upcoming creta .... go for it guys and I m getting 13 avg in Delhi city traffic before my 1st service.

"I had taken test drive Three Times to convince myself to take delivery of the GTX Plus AT , which I booked pre-launch. Unfortunately, more I drived, more dissatisfied from all angles. Cost is too High - Top Model 20.50 lakhs. Fuel average not more than 9 or 10 KMPH when I reset to Zero and tested myself. Seating in both rows is very uncomfortable. Navigation is very confusing. HUD is distracting during driving. Sun-Roof is First Manual opening & then Electric . Diffrent drive mode could not be tested during test drive, so not sure about their performance. Test vehicle Tyre pressure shows 47: 45:41: 46. Sales man told that they will get adjusted in Workshop. As its a wrong measurements. Its a complete waste of money and will be proven a complete failure vehicle. Adding 1.5 lakhs, I will go for CIVIC which is a luxurious and full comfort car in but that too when will be available in BS-VI engine only.","October 14, 2019",1,carwale.com

Build quality is top class compared to other cars in the segment and safety features are top-notch. Paint quite is nice this thing will no reviewer shows.. The engine is so refined in diesel. Slightly stiff suspension. Rear ac vents are not effective.. Mismanagement on dealerships. No auto-dimming orvm. Fixed headrest for rear seats.,"December 13, 2019",4,carwale.com
"The car is undoubtedly the best in SUV segment. I have driven Creta & MG Hector both when I wanted to buy a SUV. Seltos is far ahead of Creta and marginally ahead of MG Hector. People had no option and they had to go for Creta (Majburi). Creta was a majburi for people looking for SUV. People who own Creta very well know that KIa Seltos is far ahead of them. I think Kia Seltos gives the best drive experience, Comfort, safety, features and very refined petrol engine. I am seeing many people commenting about airbags & safety. No car in the range of 12-14 lakhs offer 6 airbags.","October 18, 2019",5,carwale.com

"I had booked the HTK plus automatic diesel, the car looks good from inside and outside but when I took the test drive it was very underpowered car 1.5 with 115 bhp is very less for a car of this size, no punch in the engine.

"I don't understand that why Kia not offering safety features in this variant like 6 airbags and other features very disappointed Then what is the benefit of taking the top end variant of diesel Why is the GT line being given so much importance, Should have given all the features with the diesel version too I hope Kia is noticed","September 09, 2019",2,carwale.com
"This car is so amazing the looks are extravagant.., I just book this car and I m waiting eagerly for its delivery...The front end of the Seltos is particularly impressive – the huge ‘Tiger Nose’ grille is Kia’s design trademark. The entry-level engine will be a 1.5-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine, producing 113bhp and 144Nm, The quality levels of the Seltos – of both versions of the car that we tested – are simply phenomenal. From plastics and soft-touch surfaces to digital screens and general fit-and-finish, everything is simply class-leading.","August 24, 2019",5,carwale.com
"First of all, I would like to confess that I am very obsessed with my car. I was very nervous while buying this car as Kia was launching its first vehicle in India. I took a test drive for at least seven to eight times before I made my decision to finally buy this. When I took the first test drive I was blown away when I listened to the audio quality of bose speakers. It was an amazing experience it was like I was in a live concert on the front sofa. The driving quality was also awesome. It runs like butter. Build quality could have been better. I strongly recommend this beast to anyone who really wants to enjoy driving with great entertainment.","November 30, 2019",5,carwale.com

"Too many variants to choose. Ultimate strategy is to push custimers for top spec variants . Cheap strategy from the company.

The car is tailor made for the family looking for feature rich experience in low budget without compromising on styling and features. Super drive quality and awesome road presence. As per me it's the best looking car in this segment. As per the company the maintenance of the car would be the least in its segment and spare parts would be available in all major metro cities. Complaint with BSVI thus making the car for future as well. Pros: 1. Value for money 2. Styling 3. Features 4. 3year Unlimited kilometer waranty with 2year extended warranty available 5. Ride experience is major plus Cons: 1. New product need to wait for few months for more detailed review. 2. Servicing would be bit on rush as few centers available initially but I guess that can be managed as company would expand As per me go for it for the features and ride experience. Plus the pricing has killed all the competitors according to me. Great product KIA.,"August 23, 2019",5,carwale.com

"First of all its a Korean brand, you get a feel-good material inside and out, loads of features of course, however, what brings me down is the engine reliability of Korean brands, they are no way near Japanese brands league and I meant nowhere near. Korean brands have unnecessarily ridiculous expensive parts which make no sense at all.being a Korean brand and still expensive parts, really. Unreal. That's why your high-end cars are almost extinct. To all the Korean car manufacturers, please make the reliable engine and drop your car parts prices where you compensate all your expenditure on high-end cars which are almost invisible on roads.","November 13, 2019",3,carwale.com

Noisy cabin, cheap plastic is used. However, it deserves 3 stars for its look. In this price range, you can choose Tata harrier without having a second thought.

"Price Is Too High;
Price bracket for Kia Seltos is too large. The base model is 9.69 and the top one is 15.99. Price of base and is cool. And specification doesn't vary too much. Only some additional features like Sunroof, alloy wheels, hud, and some other small features are different. So its a huge price gap between base and top. Read More","Aug 23, 2019",1,cardekho.com
"Worst Car;
Worst experience with Kia Seltos, there is no drive modes in diesel automatic and not good safety features like airbags as it gives only 2 airbags in the top diesel model. Tata Harrier is giving 6 airbags. Read More","Aug 22, 2019",2,cardekho.com
"Price Is Too HIgh;
Kia Seltos price is too high if the top variant can below 16 lakh then it could be no.1. car in the segment. Desperately now hector will be no1 and Tata harrier is no2 and Kia Seltos is no 3 position. Read More","Aug 22, 2019",1,cardekho.com

"Don't go with hype, just take test drive and then decide.
After looking at 5 star hype on internet of Kia Seltos, today I took test drive for KIA seltos. Simply not super almost like Breeza design n same built quality. About interiors only top end has Bose Speakers other variants have normal ones. No cold glove box or light even in top end Seltos. Most of the parts are not imported and manufacture in AP t...Read More","Aug 18, 2019",1,cardekho.com
"No Hopes For AMT Buyers;
Kia Seltos is a total disappointment for AMT buyers as HTX & GTX variant costs 18-18.5lakh on-road Mumbai (HTK+ variant Doesn't justify its 15lakh on-road Mumbai price tag). Better to opt for Creta AMT & save a lakh or wait for Tata harrier AMT & save some funds meanwhile. Read More","Aug 22, 2019",1,cardekho.com
"Do Not Go By Bookes And Promises;
Don't just go by books and promises. I seriously doubt automatic versions of Kia Seltos as mileage claimed versus actual performance may have a huge difference. I suspect that diesel won't give more than 10-11 km/l and petrol won't go beyond 9 km/l.     Read More","Aug 22, 2019",3,cardekho.com
"Not as good as hiked on internet - Kia Seltos
The iron sheet is very thin. Seems like the company did a compromise with quality to provide the cheapest Kia. The gap between suspensions and tyres is very low so there is a high possibility of getting damaged when it passes through the Indian speed breakers. Variant distribution is not proper. What does mean to launch 8 variants? Or HT variant is...Read More","Aug 07, 2019",2,cardekho.com

"Lovely car
The car comes with very good looks, engine power, and other features are same as Mahindra XUV 300. The pricing of the car should be less than Mahindra XUV 300 or else it will be hard to compete in the Indian market. Read More","Jul 11, 2019",3,cardekho.com
